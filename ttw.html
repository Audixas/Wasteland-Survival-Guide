    <hr>
    <p>
        In this step, we will install and activate Tale of Two Wastelands through Mod Organizer 2.
    </p>
      <blockquote>
        If you run into any errors when installing, check the <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> to see if it has the solution.
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure both Mod Organizer 2 and the game are closed.</li>
        <li>From the <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl" target="_blank">TTW Download</a> page, download the <strong>3.3 Installer</strong> file.</li>
        <li>Extract the contents of the <strong>3.3 Installer</strong> archive to a new folder called <strong>TTW Installer</strong> 
          in a safe location <abbr title="Do not use any folder falling under UAC such as Program Files, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc. 
          Use a simple location like C:/Modding">outside of any default Windows folders.</abbr>
        </li>
        <li>Once everything has been extracted, navigate to <code>Mod Organizer 2\mods\</code> and create a folder there named <strong>Tale of Two Wastelands</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
        If you are unsure as to where/what your MO2 <b>Mods</b> folder is, open up MO2, select the <img style="width:2%" src="./img/mo2 folders.png" alt="mo2 folders">
        button at the top, and select <strong>Open Mods folder</strong>.
      </blockquote>
      <ol start="5">
        <li>Back in the <strong>TTW Installer</strong> folder, right-click the <strong>TTW Install.exe</strong> and select <strong>Run As Administrator</strong>.</li>
        <li>In the installer, verify that the automatically set file paths for both your Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas installations are correct.</li>
        <li>Set the Tale of Two Wastelands install path to the <code>Mod Organizer 2\mods\Tale of Two Wastelands</code> you created in step 4.</li>
        <img src="./img/install.png" alt="Install paths for 3.3 installation">
        <li>Ensure your paths look similar to the example above, then select <strong>Install</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote class="red"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
        The install may take a long time as the .ogg encoding is very CPU-intensive. It takes about 40 minutes on my 5600x but could take several hours or even longer on a slower CPU.<br>
        It is recommended to leave your computer alone and have any CPU-intensive applications closed during this time so as to not overheat your CPU and cause the TTW installation to fail.
      </blockquote>


      <h3><i class="far fa-check-square"></i> Activating TTW in Mod Organizer 2</h3>
      <ol start="9">
        <li>Launch Mod Organizer 2</li>
        <li>If you installed TTW correctly with the correct filepaths, you should see the <strong>Tale of Two Wastelands</strong> mod in the left pane of MO2</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If you do not see anything, you did not install TTW to the correct folder. Find out where the files were installed to and move them to <code>Mod Organizer 2\mods\Tale of Two Wastelands</code></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Click the checkbox next to it in the left pane, and the right pane should fill with plugins</li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote class="blue"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
        You can now safely uninstall Fallout 3.
