        <p>Introduction to the Root Builder workflow when installing new mods or maintaining your modlist.</p>
        <h3>What is Root Builder?</h3>
            <p>This MO2 plugin will allow you to install mods such as xNVSE in MO2, this way the game folder will never need any modification and you will be able to track all newly generated files.
            Root Builder by default (This is also the best mode for compatibility) works by copying files to the root folder when <strong>building</strong> and removing those files when <strong>clearing</strong>, with a few other functions we will look into later.</p>
        <h3>How does it keep my root folder clean?</h3>
            <p>When you build for the first time in this guide, Root Builder with cache all the hashes of your game root files (Except the Data folder because MO2 handles it). This way when you want to revert your root folder to a clean state, the plugin will know how the original folder looked like.</p>
            <blockquote class="blue"><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Simply put, file hashes are what allows Root Builder to differentiate 2 copies of the same file, for example the original FNV executable and the 4GB aware version of it.</blockquote>
        <h3>Tracking newly generated files</h3>
            <p>When you clear, Root Builder will revert all your base files via hashes and the backup it stored. Any file that belongs to a mod in MO2 will simply be removed from root, ready for another build in the future. But what happens to files that popped up in your game folder between the first build and this clear?</p>
            <p>Let's say for example that you have a new .log file in your root folder, and this file is not part of the base game root folder nor any mod in MO2. Upon clearing this will be sent to your overwrite folder in MO2, effectively letting you track any file created by your mods while the game is running.</p>
