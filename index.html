<h3><i class="fas fa-radiation"></i> Intro</h3>
<p><strong>Tale of Two Wastelands</strong> is a total conversion project that seamlessly merges Fallout 3 and its DLC into Fallout: New Vegas, allowing both games to be played in a single playthrough. It upgrades Fallout 3's mechanics to those of FNV without compromising the feel and balance of the original. New Vegas mechanics like companion wheel, companion perks, weapon mods, crafting, recipes, harvestable plants, and poisons have been added to the DC wasteland items, NPCs, and world.</p>
<p>The following guide will walk you through installing and customizing some of the most essential mods to enrich your experience with the game! Patches and settings will be provided where necessary as well as a load order to ensure a smooth modding experience for users of any level of experience.</p>
