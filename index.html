    <h2><i class="fas fa-radiation"></i> A Tale of Two Wastelands 3.3.1 Modding Guide</h2>

    <p>
        <b><a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl" target="_blank">Tale of Two Wastelands</a></b> is a total conversion project that seamlessly merges Fallout 3 and its DLC into Fallout: New Vegas, allowing both games to be played in a single playthrough.
        It upgrades Fallout 3's mechanics to those of FNV without compromising the feel and balance of the original. New Vegas mechanics such as a fully functional companion wheel, companion perks, weapon mods, crafting, recipes, harvestable plants, and
        poisons have been added to the DC wasteland.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following guide will walk you through installing and customizing some of the most essential mods to enrich your experience with the game! Patches and settings will be provided where necessary as well as a load order to ensure a smooth experience regardless
        of your modding skill level.

    <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> About the Guide</h2>

    <p>Wasteland Survival Guide is a modding guide for TTW that will carefully walk you through how to install all the mods you will need for a perfectly stable, smooth, and most importantly, enjoyable experience. Unlike other modding guides, it is built
        with customization in mind. Mods are subjective, so every mod listed in the guide is 100% optional. Custom patches and a hand-made load order will be provided for the guide, and they will still work if you skipped any mods.</p>
    <p><strong>If you are continuing from the official TTW Installation Guide</strong> (The Best of Times), you should start this guide at the
        <a href="./utilities.html">Utilities</a> section. Most of the mods in that section you will already have, however you should update/add whatever you are missing, which should include:
        <ul>
            <li>AnhNVSE</li>
            <li>yGTM</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>Once again, <strong>you do not have to install every one of these mods!</strong> The guide is designed to be modular, and while it is strongly recommended to get all <strong>Utilities</strong> & <strong>Bugfixes</strong>, you are free to skip any
        other mods you wish in any of the sections that follow. The load order provided at the end of the guide will still work</blockquote>
