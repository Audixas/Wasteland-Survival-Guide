        <p>In this step, we will install and configure Mod Organizer 2, the best mod manager for any Bethesda game.</p>

        <h3>Installing Mod Organizer 2</h3>
        <blockquote class="red"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> If you are about to ignore this section or
            do it differently because you already have Mod Organizer 2 installed for a different game somewhere else, do
            not get confused. Download and run the installer
            again anyway - the following steps apply to absolutely <strong>everyone</strong>. While it may seem
            counter-intuitive, you need to <strong>download the installer again</strong> and make a new <strong>portable
                instance</strong>. This is the
            case no matter how many other MO2 setups you may already have - this guide will completely ignore those
            setups by design</blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the <strong>Mod Organizer 2</strong> main file from <a
                    href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files" target="_blank">here</a>
            </li>
            <li>Once the download has finished, run the installer</li>
            <li>When prompted to choose an install location, pick any unoccupied location outside of any default Window
                folders and outside of the game's <strong>Root</strong> folder (e.g.
                <code>C:/Modding/Mod Organizer 2/</code>)</li>
            <li>Although it doesn't technically have to be installed on the same drive as the game, it is still
                recommended to install on an SSD if possible</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> until the installer finishes</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Initial Setup</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Run <strong>ModOrganizer.exe</strong></li>
            <li>You will be prompted with a pop-up called <strong>Creating an instance</strong>, in which you should
                just select <strong>Next</strong></li>
            <li>On the next page, select <strong>Create a portable instance</strong></li>
            <img src="./img/MO2 portable.png" alt="portable instance">
            <li>On the next page, select <strong>TTW</strong></li>
            <img src="./img/MO2-install-TTW.png" alt="TTW option of MO2">
            <li>On the next page, keep the <strong>Location</strong> file path default</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>
            If you have MO2 installed on an SSD or a HDD with little space, you can check the <strong>Show advanced
                options</strong> box and change the <strong>Downloads</strong> file path to a different drive with more
            space. This will not affect download/game performance, and the downloads can be deleted after the mods have
            been installed.
        </blockquote>

        <ol start="6">
            <li>On the last page, select <strong>Finish</strong></li>
            <li>MO2 will launch and prompt you with a pop-up called <strong>Show tutorial?</strong>, in which you should
                select <strong>No</strong></li>
            <li>From the pop-up called <strong>Register?</strong>, select <strong>Yes</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This pop-up will not show up if you have already registered a different instance of MO2</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>Root Builder Setup</h3>
        If you want to know how Root Builder works, read <a href="./rootbuilder.html">here.</a> Steps will be provided
        anyway in case you only want to follow along without understanding the plugin.
        <ol>
            <li>Download the <strong>Root Builder</strong> main file from <a
                    href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31720?tab=files" target="_blank">here</a>
            </li>
            <li>Once the download has finished, click the <img src="./img/mo2 folders.png" alt="mo2 folders"> button at
                the top of MO2 and select <strong>Open MO2 Plugins Folder</strong></li>
            <li>Place the <strong>rootbuilder</strong> folder from the extracted archive into the opened folder</li>
            <img src="./img/rootbuilderlocation.png" alt="Root Builder Location">
            <li><strong>Close Mod Organizer 2</strong> and open it again so the plugin can be detected before moving
                onto the next section</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Configuring Settings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If there is a plugin called <strong>FalloutNV_lang.esp</strong> in the right pane of Mod Organizer 2,
                navigate to the game's <strong>Data</strong> folder and delete it</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you do not know what the game's <strong>Data</strong> folder is, read the Key Terminology section
                    from the <a class="sublink" href="./setup.html#terms" target="_blank">Initial Setup</a> page</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>
            The translation plugin must be deleted because it directly edits 1000s of records to change the language,
            which will cause many incompatibilities with most mods.
        </blockquote>

        <ol start="2">
            <li>Select the <img src="./img/mo2%20settings.png" alt="mo2 settings"> button at the top of MO2 to open the
                settings
            </li>
            <li>In the <strong>Theme</strong> tab, you can select a different style from the drop-down menu at the top
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Many: I use the <strong>dracula</strong> theme</li>
                <li>Audixas: I use <strong>vs15 Dark-Green</strong> for TTW</li>
                <li>VishVadeva50: I use <strong>1809 Dark Mode</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <li>In the <strong>Nexus</strong> tab, select <strong>Connect to Nexus</strong></li>
            <img src="./img/mo2%20connect.png" alt="connect to nexus">
            <ul>
                <li>This option will not show up if you have already connected your Nexus account on a different MO2
                    instance
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>MO2 will open your browser and prompt you to authorize the connection</li>
            <li>Once you authorize it, you can close out of your browser and of the MO2 settings</li>
            <li>Allow MO2 to restart if it asks</li>
            <li>In the <strong>Plugins</strong> tab, select <b>RootBuilder</b> in the left pane, then set "autobuild" to
                false in the dropdown on the right</li>
            <img src="./img/autobuild.png" alt="disable autobuild">
            <blockquote>
                If at any point you get a pop-up called <strong>INI file is read-only</strong>, select <strong>Remember
                    my choice</strong> from the drop-down at the bottom then click <strong>Clear the read-only
                    flag</strong>
            </blockquote>
            <li>Select the <img src="./img/mo2 profiles.png" alt="mo2 profiles"> button at the top of MO2 to open the
                profiles menu</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>Default</strong> profile and make sure both <strong>Use profile-specific Game INI
                    Files</strong> and <strong>Automatic Archive Invalidation</strong> are checked at the bottom</li>
            <img src="./img/mo2 profile settings.png" alt="mo2 profile settings">
        </ol>

        <h3>Tweaking FalloutCustom.ini</h3>
        <p>
            In this step, we will configure the game's INI files to increase performance/stability. We will take
            advantage of JIP LN NVSE's FalloutCustom.ini feature to make our changes, which allows for INI changes to be
            made safely without editing the default INIs.
            Because of this, these changes will not take affect until you install JIP LN NVSE in the <a
                href="./utilities.html#jip" target="_blank">Utilities</a> step.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <img src="./img/mo2%20ini.png" alt="mo2 ini button"> button at the top of MO2 and select
                <strong>INI
                    Editor</strong></li>
            <li>Select the <strong>FalloutCustom.ini</strong> tab, which should be blank</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you are in the <strong>FalloutCustom.ini</strong> tab and NOT the
                    <strong>Custom.ini</strong> tab</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Paste in the following:</li>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
            It is highly recommended to avoid changing any other INI settings not in the guide, and to avoid using INI
            "optimization" tools like BethINI. The changes these will make are placebo at best and dangerous at worst.
            You will realistically not need any other
            tweaks than the ones already in the guide.
        </p>
        <h3>Mod Installation Advice</h3>
        <blockquote>
            If you are completely unfamiliar with Mod Organizer 2, I recommended watching <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v0wWVuOagA" target="_blank">GamerPoet's video</a> about mod
            installation in MO2. As it was made for Skyrim, it has some
            information that does not apply to New Vegas, such as the Steam Workshop part which you can just ignore.
            However, the rest of the information about downloading/installing mods from Nexus still applies.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            When the guide says to install a mod, it will be formatted as follows: <strong>Main File - Example Mod
                1.5</strong>. This is referring to the mod's category on Nexus, the file name, and the file version.
            <br><br>
            <img src="./img/download%20example.png" alt="download example"> <br> <br> Unless instructed otherwise,
            simply download the listed file using the <strong>Mod Manager Download</strong> button and install it
            normally through MO2. If you do not
            know how to install mods through MO2, please watch the video linked above. Sometimes, a mod will not have a
            <strong>Mod Manager Download</strong>, or will be hosted on a site other than Nexus. If that is the case, do
            the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong>Manual Download</strong> button (or whatever the download button is for the respective
                site)</li>
            <li>Once the download has finished, click the <img src="./img/mo2%20archive.png" alt="mo2 archive button">
                button at the top of MO2 or use the CTRL + M shortcut.</li>
            <li>From the new window, navigate to where the file was downloaded to and double-click it</li>
            <li>Finish the install normally</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            When downloading multiple files from the same page, you will be prompted with a box in Mod Organizer 2 with
            the options <strong>Merge</strong>, <strong>Replace</strong>, and <strong>Rename</strong>. You should select
            the <strong>Rename</strong> option and rename the mod to its respective file name. This will make MO2
            install them as separate files for easier management. If you are updating from an old version of a mod, you
            should select <strong>Replace</strong>. This will delete
            all the files from the old version of the mod and replace them,with the ones from the new version. This is
            the only time you should use the <strong>Replace</strong> option, otherwise always use
            <strong>Rename</strong>.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blue"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> If at any point during mod installation you get a
            message called <strong>Extract BSA</strong>, select
            <strong>No</strong>
        </blockquote>
