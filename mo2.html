	The following MO2 installation guide has been slightly modified and used with permission from our good friend Qolore7,
	who you may know from the incredible <a href="https://vivanewvegas.github.io/"><b>Viva New Vegas</b></a> guide.
	For all your New Vegas modding needs, look no further than VNV, and a massive thanks to Qolore for these thorough instructions!
</blockquote>

<div>
	<p>In this step, we will install and configure Mod Organizer 2, the best mod manager for any Bethesda game.</p>
		<h4>Installing Mod Organizer 2</h4></a>
			<ol>
				<li>Download the <b>Mod Organizer 2</b> main file from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files" target="_blank">here</a></li>
				<li>Once the download has finished, run the installer</li>
				<li>When prompted to choose an install location, pick any location outside of any default Window folders and outside of the game's <b>Root</b> folder</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Although it doesn't technically have to be installed on the same drive as the game, it is still recommended to install on an SSD if possible</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Click <b>Next</b> until the installer finishes</li>
			</ol>
		<h4>Configuring Mod Organizer 2</h4>       
			<h5>Initial Setup</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>Run <b>ModOrganizer.exe</b></li>
					<li>You will be prompted with a pop-up called <b>Creating an instance</b>, in which you should just select <b>Next</b></li>
					<li>On the next page, select <b>Create a portable instance</b></li>
						<img src="./img/MO2 portable.png" alt="portable instance">
					<li>On the next page, select <b>TTW</b></li>
						<img src="./img/MO2-install-TTW.png" alt="TTW option of MO2">
					<li>On the next page, keep the <b>Location</b> file path default</li>
				</ol>
				<blockquote>
					If you have MO2 installed on an SSD or a HDD with little space, you can check the <b>Show advanced options</b> box
					and change the <b>Downloads</b> file path to a different drive with more space. This will not effect download/game performance,
					and the downloads can be deleted after the mods have been installed.
				</blockquote>
				<ol start="6">
					<li>On the last page, select <b>Finish</b></li>
					<li>MO2 will launch and prompt you with a pop-up called <b>Show tutorial?</b>, in which you should select <b>No</b></li>
					<li>From the pop-up called <b>Register?</b>, select <b>Yes</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li>This pop-up will not show up if you have already registered a different instance of MO2</li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
			<h4>Configuring Settings</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>If there is a plugin called <b>FalloutNV_lang.esp</b> in the right pane of Mod Organizer 2, navigate to the game's <b>Data</b> folder and delete it</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If you do not know what the game's <b>Data</b> folder is, read the Key Terminology section from the <a class="sublink" href="./setup.html#terms" target="_blank">Initial Setup</a> page</li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
				<blockquote>
					The translation plugin must be deleted because it directly edits 1000s of records to change the language, which will cause many incompatibilities with most mods.
				</blockquote>     
				<ol start="2">
					<li>Select the <img src="./img/mo2 settings.png" alt="mo2 settings"> button at the top of MO2 to open the settings</li>
					<li>In the <b>Theme</b> tab, you can select a different style from the drop-down menu at the top</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The Many: I use the <b>dracula</b> theme.</li>
							<li>Audixas: I use <b>vs15 Dark-Green</b> for TTW.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>In the <b>Nexus</b> tab, select <b>Connect to Nexus</b></li>
						<img src="./img/mo2 connect.png" alt="connect to nexus">
						<ul>
							<li>This option will not show up if you have already connected your Nexus account on a different MO2 instance</li>
						</ul>
					<li>MO2 will open your browser and prompt you to authorize the connection</li>
					<li>Once you authorize it, you can close out of your browser and of the MO2 settings</li>
					<li>Allow MO2 to restart if it asks</li>
				</ol>
				<blockquote>
					If at any point you get a pop-up called <b>INI file is read-only</b>,
					select <b>Remember my choice</b> from the drop-down at the bottom
					then click <b>Clear the read-only flag</b> 
				</blockquote>

		<h3><i class="fas fa-paste"></i> INI Tweaks</h3>
			<h5>Tweaking FalloutCustom.ini</h5>
				<p>
					In this step, we will configure the game's INI files to increase performance/stability.
					We will take advantage of JIP LN NVSE's FalloutCustom.ini feature to make our changes,
					which allows for INI changes to be made safely without editing the default INIs. Because of this, these changes will not take affect until you install 
					JIP LN NVSE in the <a href="./utilities.html#jip" target="_blank">Utilities</a> step.
				</p>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Make sure the <b>The Best of Times</b> profile is active</li>
					<li>Click the <img src="./img/mo2 ini.png" alt="mo2 ini button"> button at the top of MO2 and select <b>INI Editor</b></li>
					<li>Select the <b>FalloutCustom.ini</b> tab, which should be blank</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Make sure you are in the <b>FalloutCustom.ini</b> tab and NOT the <b>Custom.ini</b> tab</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Paste in the following:</li>
						<ul>

</textarea>
						</ul>
					<li>Repeat the INI changes on the <b>Testing</b> profile</li>
				</ol>
			<h5>Notes</h5>
				<p>
					It is highly recommended to avoid changing any other INI settings not in the guide, and to avoid using INI "optimization" tools like BethINI.
					The changes these will make are placebo at best and dangerous at worst. You will realistically not need any other tweaks than the ones
					already in the guide.
				</p>
		<h4>Mod Installation Advice</h4>
			<blockquote>
				If you are completely unfamiliar with Mod Organizer 2, I recommended watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v0wWVuOagA" target="_blank">GamerPoet's video</a> about mod installation in MO2. 
				As it was made for Skyrim, it has some information that does not apply to New Vegas, such as the Steam Workshop part which you can just ignore.
				However, the rest of the information about downloading/installing mods from Nexus still applies.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				When the guide says to install a mod, it will be formatted as follows: <b>Main File - Example Mod 1.5</b>. This is referring to the mod's category on Nexus, the file name, and the file version.
					<br> <br>
					<img style="width:85%;" src="./img/download example.png" alt="download example"> <br> <br>
				Unless instructed otherwise, simply download the listed file using the <b>Mod Manager Download</b> button and install it normally through MO2. 
				If you do not know how to install mods through MO2, please watch the video linked above. Sometimes, a mod will not have a <b>Mod Manager Download</b>, or
				will be hosted on a site other than Nexus. If that is the case, do the following: 
			</p>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Click the <b>Manual Download</b> button (or whatever the download button is for the respective site)</li>
				<li>Once the download has finished, click the <img src="./img/mo2 archive.png" alt="mo2 archive button"> button at the top of MO2</li>
				<li>From the new window, navigate to where the file was downloaded to and double-click it</li>
				<li>Finish the install normally</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p>
				When downloading multiple files from the same page, you will be prompted with a box in Mod Organizer 2 with the options <b>Merge</b>, <b>Replace</b>, and <b>Rename</b>.
				You should select the <b>Rename</b> option and rename the mod to its respective file name. This will make MO2 install them as separate files for easier management.
				If you are updating from an old version of a mod, you should select <b>Replace</b>. This will delete all the files from the old version of the mod and replace them,with the ones from the new version.
				This is the only time you should use the <b>Replace</b> option, otherwise always use <b>Rename</b>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				If at any point during mod installation you get a message called <b>Extract BSA</b>, select <b>No</b>
			</p>
